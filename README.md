# Facebook Messenger - dark

**Notice**: [As of December 2020](https://github.com/auscompgeek/fb-messenger-dark/issues/44), this theme no longer works due to Facebook having rewritten messenger.com. As such, this is being discontinued and will no longer be maintained.

@cicerakes maintains [another dark theme](https://github.com/cicerakes/DarkNight-FBMessenger) as an alternative.

So long, and thanks for all the fish.

## FAQ
* Where did all the commit messages go?

  This style was originally maintained on Gist. Upon creating the repo on
  GitHub, I reused the commit history of the Gist, hence the missing commit
  messages for the older commits.
